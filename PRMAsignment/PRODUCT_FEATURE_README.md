## API Endpoints

The product feature uses these backend endpoints:

```
GET    /api/products              - Get all products
GET    /api/products/{id}         - Get product by ID
POST   /api/products              - Create new product
PUT    /api/products/{id}         - Update product
DELETE /api/products/{id}         - Delete product
```

```

## How to Access Products

1. **From Home Screen**: Tap the products icon in the top-left corner
2. **Programmatically**: 
   ```java
   Intent intent = new Intent(context, ProductActivity.class);
   startActivity(intent);
   ```

## Product Model Fields

The product model includes comprehensive pet food information:

- **Basic Info**: ID, name, description, price, stock quantity, image URL
- **Categories**: Category ID, Brand ID
- **Pet Specific**: Pet type (Dog/Cat), life stage (Puppy/Adult), special needs
- **Physical**: Weight in kg
- **Timestamps**: Created at, updated at

## Integration with Cart Feature

Products integrate seamlessly with the cart system:

### Add to Cart from Product List
- Direct "Add to Cart" button on each product
- Uses existing CartUtils.addProductToCart() method
- Default quantity of 1, customizable

### Add to Cart from Product Details
- Prominent "Add to Cart" button
- Stock validation before adding
- Button disabled for out-of-stock items
- Success/failure feedback

## Search Functionality

- **Real-time Search**: Results update as you type
- **Multiple Fields**: Searches name, description, and pet type
- **Case Insensitive**: Works regardless of capitalization
- **Instant Feedback**: Immediate result filtering

## Authentication & Permissions

- **Login Required**: All product operations require authentication
- **Token-based**: Uses existing SessionManager for API authentication  
- **Role-based**: Admin users have full CRUD access
- **Customer Access**: Customers can view products and add to cart

## Error Handling

- **Network Errors**: Toast messages for connectivity issues
- **Validation Errors**: Input field validation with user feedback
- **Empty States**: Friendly messages for no products
- **Stock Validation**: Prevents adding out-of-stock items to cart

## Testing Product Feature

1. **Login** to the app with valid credentials
2. **Navigate** to products from home screen (products icon)
3. **View Products**: See list of all available products
4. **Search**: Use search bar to find specific products
5. **View Details**: Tap "View" on any product for detailed information
6. **Add to Cart**: Test adding products to cart from list or detail view
7. **Admin Functions** (if admin):
   - Create new products using "Add Product" button
   - Edit existing products using "Edit" button
   - Delete products using "Delete" button

## Backend Integration Notes

Ensure your Spring Boot backend:
1. **Has matching API endpoints** as specified above
2. **Returns Product objects** in the expected format
3. **Handles authentication** properly with Bearer tokens
4. **Validates input data** server-side
5. **Manages stock quantities** accurately

## Integration with Existing Features

### Cart Integration
```java
// Adding product to cart
CartUtils.addProductToCart(this, productId, quantity);
```

### Navigation Integration
- Products accessible from home screen toolbar
- Consistent UI patterns with cart feature
- Proper back navigation support

### Session Management
- Uses existing SessionManager for authentication
- Consistent token handling across features
- Proper logout/session cleanup

## Future Enhancements

1. **Image Loading**: Integrate Glide or Picasso for proper image loading
2. **Categories Filter**: Add category-based filtering
3. **Wishlist**: Save favorite products
4. **Product Reviews**: User ratings and reviews
5. **Inventory Tracking**: Real-time stock updates
6. **Product Variants**: Size, color, flavor options
7. **Bulk Operations**: Multiple product management for admins
8. **Advanced Search**: Filters by price, brand, category

## Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Consider implementing pagination for large product lists
- **Image Optimization**: Compress and cache product images
- **Search Optimization**: Debounce search queries to reduce API calls
- **Memory Management**: Proper disposal of resources in activities

## Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated both client and server-side
- **Authentication Required**: All operations require valid tokens
- **Role-based Access**: Different permissions for admin vs customer
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries on backend
- **XSS Prevention**: Proper input sanitization

This product feature provides a solid foundation for e-commerce functionality and can be easily extended with additional features as needed.
